## Code Overview

The C++ code for the calculator is defined in the `Calculator.h` header file, which is included in the JNI implementation file. The `Calculator` class implements four basic arithmetic operations: `sum`, `minus`, `times`, and `divide`.

The JNI implementation file is named `cplusplusintegration.cpp` and defines the interface between the C++ code and the Java code. It exports four functions: `create`, `delete`, `sum`, `minus`, `times`, and `divide`. The `create` function creates a new instance of the `Calculator` class and returns a handle to it, while the `delete` function destroys a previously created instance. The other four functions call the respective arithmetic operations of the `Calculator` class.

The `ALOG` macro is used to log messages to the Android logging system. The messages are tagged with the `testjni` tag and have different log levels depending on the severity of the message.

## Usage

To use the C++ calculator in an Android application, the `NativeCalculator` class must be instantiated and its methods called. The `create` method must be called first to create a new instance of the calculator, which returns a handle that must be passed to the other methods. The `delete` method must be called to destroy the calculator instance when it is no longer needed.

The `sum`, `minus`, `times`, and `divide` methods call the respective arithmetic operations of the calculator and return the result. If any error occurs, the methods return `-1`.
